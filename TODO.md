- [x] See the name of the project that we submited and create the repo

- [x] Make the request to the API of OpenAI and render the response

  2.1 How would we render the response

  2.2 How would be the UI. Use v0 from vercel maybe

  2.3 We dont store the responses

- [ ] Smart contracts from SRE
- Create the vouchers flow in a similar way to SRE.
- Store the vouchers in mongo
- Join the vouchers with the requests API

* Integrate other AI models. I think it is a good model to use ETH. Nobody wants to use it becuase traditional banking services are really good. But ETH is suppose to be frictionless internet money, so it seems fit to use it to exchange internet assets i.e. (90% of the time) INFORMATION

Example with OpenAi API ~/Desktop/learn/speedRunEthereum/fproject/openAItest
